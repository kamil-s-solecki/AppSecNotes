# SecNotes
Notes on AppSec. Tools, Vulnerabilities, Methodologies, tips etc.

A lot of tools/resources gathered here are and wil be obvious, but the goal is to keep all useful things in one place.

The list will grow with time. I'll try to keep updating it as much as I can.

Feel free to contribute :)
